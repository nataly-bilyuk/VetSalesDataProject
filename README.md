You have been approached by some local businesses to help them visualize their sales performance in terms of sales and profit by store.

You need to pick one of the businesses above to use for your pilot study, you are given raw data in the form of a text file of a business you are interested in.

They also wish to include customer buying habits, in terms of what was purchased and how often they would also like to know how the products were paid for.

All data must be anonymized so the client's name and card details must be removed at the earliest point of the data ingestion process.
